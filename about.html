<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<div class="para">
<p>Hybe acquired Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings and all its properties, including SB Projects and Big Machine Label Group, through its subsidiary Hybe America in April. 
    The corporation invested $950 million (₩1.07 trillion) into the America branch to finance the buyout; $1.05 billion was paid to Ithaca shareholders and bondholders. 
    BH Odyssey Merger Sub, a newly created subsidiary of Hybe America, facilitated the acquisition, and was later dissolved after the deal's finalization. 
    The Carlyle Group, a minority shareholder and original investor, sold its stake in Ithaca as part of the deal. 
    Braun joined Hybe's board, while Scott Borchetta retained his position as CEO of Big Machine. <br>
    That same month, Time named Hybe one of the "100 Most Influential Companies of 2021", under the "Pioneers" section.
    Japanese streaming platform Showroom announced a business and capital partnership with Hybe in May 2021 to improve its domestic services and expand access to Japanese content in South Korea, 
    the United States, and globally. <br>
    Hybe was added to the MSCI Korea index on May 12, and the index updated on May 28.
    Following a second organizational restructuring, Bang resigned as CEO on July 1 to return his focus to music production. 
    He was replaced by Park Ji-won but retained his position as chairman of the board of directors. 
    In November, Hybe entered into an equity-based partnership with Korean fintech company Dunamu to develop a joint venture NFT business for the creation of digital assets.
    It acquired a 2.6% stake in the company for ₩500 billion ($423.8 million), while Dunamu received a 5.6% stake in Hybe for ₩700 billion ($590 million).
    On November 11, Hybe won a Red Dot Design Award in the Brands & Communication Design category at the 2021 Red Dot Design Awards for its new corporate identity (CI) design. <br>
    The establishment of a new music label, ADOR, was announced on November 12. 
    Chief Brand Officer (CBO) Min Hee-jin was appointed as its CEO and tasked with overseeing the management of the label's first girl group, later announced as NewJeans, which debuted in July 2022.
    In January 2022, Hybe published a series of "original stories" featuring boy groups BTS, Enhypen, and Tomorrow X Together in collaboration with Webtoon and Wattpad as part of a planned IP expansion. 
    The BTS comic alone earned over 15 million views within two days of release and was the highest-viewed title ever launched by Webtoon. 
    In March, Fast Company named Hybe the 11th most innovative company of the year globally on its annual top-50 list[69]—ranking first in the Media category[70]—while Time included Hybe on its 100 
    Most Influential Companies list for a second consecutive year. <br>
    The company topped the "Leaders" category and was dubbed "The Pop Powerhouse" by the outlet for its acquisitions, expansion into the digital frontier, and transformative
    strides in the music industry during the pandemic era. 
    The following month, Hybe won an iF Product Design Award for "Company Branding" in the Communication category at the International Forum Design Awards held in Germany. 
    Hybe signed a multi-year deal with The Walt Disney Company Asia Pacific in July 2022 to provide content showcasing the Korean music and entertainment industries to a global market. 
    Five programs will be available worldwide on Disney+ and other Disney streaming platforms—a 4K cinematic film of BTS' Permission to Dance on Stage concert in Los Angeles; In the Soop: 
    Friendcation; and BTS Monuments: Beyond the Star, a docuseries of BTS' history from debut to present set to premiere in 2023. 
    Additional content featuring other Hybe artists will also be released. <br>
    
    Hybe became the largest shareholder of SM Entertainment in February 2023, after it acquired founder Lee Soo-man's 14.8% stake in the company for approximately ₩422.8 billion. The company subsequently 
    acquired Galaxia SM's 1% stake on March 3. On March 12, Hybe announced that they no longer planned to own the
    majority stakes of SM Entertainment, said that the bidding war with Kakao could "damage shareholder value." On March 24, Hybe announced that it will sell its entire stake in SM Entertainment to Kakao 
    by accepting its tender offer launched by Kakao. <br>
    However, on March 28, Hybe instead sold half of its stakes in SM to Kakao, leaving it only for 8.81%.
    On May 23, Hybe signed a music distribution deal with Chinese streaming platform, Tencent Music.
    On August 10, Hybe announced its acquisition of the remaining 51.5% stake from CJ ENM in Belift Lab, making it as a wholly-owned subsidiary.
    In November, Hybe confirmed the establishment of its Latin music division, Hybe Latin America, based in Mexico City, Los Angeles, and Miami.
    On August 27, 2024, Min was dismissed as the CEO of ADOR, although she still retains her position in the company's board of directors and 
    would continue producing for NewJeans. One of the board's directors, Kim Ju-young, will take over as the new CEO of ADOR. 
    Min opposes the decision, stating that the dismissal is a "grave violation of the shareholders' agreement".</p>
