        <h1>Sooha(수하)</h1>  
        <p>She is the main female character of Dark Moon: The Blood Altar. <br>
         She is a human with special powers in the tenth grade at Decelis Academy.</p> 
         <h1>Personality & Background</h1> 
         <p>Sooha is a character who is honest and expressive with her feelings. She cares a lot about the people around her, and is always ready to protect them. She is open about how she feels and can stand up for what she thinks is right, although at times she can be a little naive and gullible.

            Sooha holds a very strong hatred towards vampires because of her ability of superhuman strength she was mysteriously born with, leading her to be constantly mistaken as a vampire and in consequence repeatedly had to move to different cities. Also, a vampire killed her only friend, Chris, when she was very young.
            
            Sooha transfers to the prestigious Decelis Academy in the town of Riverfield, which is known for having a strict policy against vampires. Sooha transfers there believing that by being a student in a school with such a policy, she will never be mistaken for a vampire ever again, let alone come face-to-face with one within its walls (or so she thought...)
            
            Additionally, one of the reasons Sooha enrolls into Decelis is to gain access to their famously extensive library, in the hopes to find an answer on how to destroy the vampire kind once and for all in order to avenge Chris' death.
            
            It is later revealed that she is in fact, the reincarnation of Selen, a princess of an Ancient Kingdom who was known for possessing special and powerful magic.

                <h1>Appearance</h1>
                <p>Sooha is considered to be a very cute and beautiful girl. She has waist-length dark brown, almost black hair with a streak of pink, and bangs. She has big pink eyes and a fair complexion with rosy cheeks. She stands at an average build and height but is noticeably shorter than her male peers.

                    Sooha is mostly seen in her school uniform which consists of a white long-sleeved collar shirt, a navy blue blazer with the Decelis Academy insignia on it, a blue and red bow tied around her neck and a dark grey skirt.
                    
                    When she is not wearing her uniform, she is seen in casual clothing like t-shirts, tops and shorts.</p>
